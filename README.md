This is a basic application that uses Nutrionix API to search over 600,000 branded food products and recipes.

Query data is posted in to a list of 10 options and once one object is selected a dynamic nutrition label and
exercise table is generated specific to the choices' nutritional information.

The purpose is to allow users to search food products based on nutritional information rather than price and allows
consumers to be more informed of what they are buying and eating.
